# Curiosity-Spark
An AI Agent generated app using Replit.

## Description
A daily discovery platform that delivers one mind-blowing fact every 24 hours. More than just a reader, it invites users to engage with the world’s most interesting data through interactive polls and community reactions.

## Overview
This app displays a fun fact of the day that only shows once per day. The user will learn a new fact (preferably to start their day) that can be intriguing or not so interesting. The user can express their reaction to the fun fact by selecting a pre-determined response and then seeing the stats of how others reacted to it. I built this app as a beginner project to help learn computer programming and also to show creativity and originality.

## Features

- New Fun Fact each day
